+ Project summary: We are assigned to compare the effect of regularizations between 1) Penalty of Magnitudes and 2) Bias and Intercepts + Temporal Dynamics using the algorithm Stochastic Gradient Descent and KNN for post-processing.

Case 1: No Regularization Term

Case 2: Adding Regularization Term **Penalty of Magnitudes** to the algorithm

Case 3: Adding Regularization Term **Bias and Intercepts + Temporal Dynamics** to the algorithm
